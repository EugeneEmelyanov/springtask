    1. Based on the codebase of previous hometasks, create a web application, configure Spring MVC application context and dispatcher servlet.

    2. For all Booking operations implement Spring MVC annotation-based controllers.
    Here is how to check:
    http://localhost:8080/booking/ticket-price?eventName=The%20revenant&auditoriumName=Blue%20hall&eventDate=2016-02-05T21:18&seats=1&userEmail=eugene.v.emelyanov@gmail.com
    http://localhost:8080/booking/book?eventName=The%20revenant&auditoriumName=Blue%20hall&eventDate=2016-02-05T21:18&seats=2,8,9,3&userEmail=eugene.v.emelyanov@gmail.com
    http://localhost:8080/booking/tickets?eventName=The%20revenant&auditoriumName=Blue%20hall&eventDate=2016-02-05T21:18


    3. For operations that return one or several entites as a result (e.g. getUserByEmail, getUsersByName, getBookedTickets) implement simple views rendered via Freemarker template engine. Use FreeMarkerViewResolver for view resolving procedure.
    Here they are:
    http://localhost:8080/auditorium?name=Yellow%20hall
    http://localhost:8080/auditorium

    http://localhost:8080/events
    http://localhost:8080/events?eventName=The%20revenant
    http://localhost:8080/events?eventName=The%20revenant&auditoriumName=Blue%20hall&eventDate=2016-02-05T21:18
    http://localhost:8080/events?to=2016-02-05T21:18&from=2016-02-05T10:00

    http://localhost:8080/user/list/?name=Eugene
    http://localhost:8080/user/1
    http://localhost:8080/user?email=eugene.v.emelyanov@gmail.com

    http://localhost:8080/tickets

        4. For operations, that return list of booked tickets (by event, or by user) implement alternative controllers, that will return result as PDF document. Map this beans.controllers to a specific value of Accept request header  - Accept=application/pdf

    5. Implement batch loading of users and events into system. In order to do this, create beans.controllers which accepts multipart file upload, parses it and calls all Booking functionality methods to add events and users into the system. The format of the file (JSON, XML, ...) is up to you as long as you can implement the correct parsing procedure.

    6. Implement generic exception handler which should redirect all beans.controllers exceptions to simple Freemarker view, that just prints exception message.
